The increase in the amount of data available presents both opportunities and problems.
In general, having more data on one’s customers (and potential customers) should allow companies to better tailor their products and marketing efforts in order to create the highest level of satisfaction and repeat business. Companies that are able to collect a large amount of data are provided with the opportunity to conduct deeper and richer analysis.
While better analysis is a positive, big data can also create overload and noise. Companies have to be able to handle larger volumes of data, all the while determining which data represents signals compared to noise. Determining what makes the data relevant becomes a key factor.
Furthermore, the nature and format of the data can require special handling before it is acted upon. Structured data, consisting of numeric values, can be easily stored and sorted. Unstructured data, such as emails, videos, and text documents, may require more sophisticated techniques to be applied before it becomes useful.

<p align="justify">KEY TAKEAWAYS
•	Big data is a great quantity of diverse information that arrives in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity.
•	Big data can be structured (often numeric, easily formatted, and stored) or unstructured (more free-form, less quantifiable).
•	Nearly every department in a company can utilize findings from big data analysis, but handling its clutter and noise can pose problems.</p>
