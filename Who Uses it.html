2. Precision Medicine:With big data, hospitals can improve the level of patient care they provide. 24×7 monitoring can be provided to intensive care patients without the need of direct supervision. On top of that, the efficiency of medication can be improved by analyzing the past records of the patients and the medicines provided to them. The need for guesswork can be significantly reduced.
In the case of certain biopharmaceuticals, there are many variables that impact the final product. For example, while manufacturing insulin intense care needs to be taken to ensure the product of desired quality. By analyzing all the factors impacting the final drug big data analysis can point out key factors that might result in incompetence in production.

3. Fraud Detection & Handling:
Banking and finance sector is using big data to predict and prevent cyber crimes, card fraud detection, archival of audit trails, etc. By analyzing the past data of their customers and the data on previous brute force attacks banks can predict future attempts.
